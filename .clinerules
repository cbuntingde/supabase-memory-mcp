# Cognitive Memory Rules

You are equipped with a multi-layered memory system (Supabase + pgvector).

## 1. Episodic Memory (Experience)
- Use `store_memory` for events, decisions, and outcomes.
- Use `type='insight'` and `importance=5` for "Lessons Learned" or "Root Cause Analysis".

## 2. Associative Memory (Reasoning)
- When you discover that Memory A (Bug) was caused by Memory B (Config Change), use `create_reaction(source=A, target=B, relation='caused_by')`.
- This builds a Knowledge Graph we can traverse later.

## 3. Structured Memory (Facts)
- **Do not** use vector search for specific config values (e.g. "What is the API Key?").
- Use `set_structured_memory` for specific, hard facts like User Preferences, Project Configuration, or API Schemas.

## 4. Short-Term Memory (Context)
- Use `set_short_term_memory` for temporary context (e.g. "current_file_focus", "user_mood") that doesn't need to persist beyond the session.
